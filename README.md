# Miscellaneous code

A place to keep all the odds and ends of code that I write or find for various projects, but which don't deserve their own repo or project. Things like little bash loops, quick R scripts for one-off analyses, SLURM/PBS templates, etc. Most of it is written by me, some is copied from other places (e.g., stackoverflow) and cited somehow.
